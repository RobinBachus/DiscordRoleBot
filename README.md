# DiscordRoleBot
A bot to auto-assign roles on a Discord server

## Important
This bot is being completely rewritten in the "Restructure" branch of this repo
and will replace the current version once it is able to manage the roles reliably.

The update focuses mainly on scalability and better code practices.

But in the end it is still mostly a project for learning and fun, 
so there will be "unnecessary" components to this bot.
